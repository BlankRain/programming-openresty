== Testing Erroneous Cases

Most robust software invests heavily on error handling, and naturally test
designers focus on corner cases and erroneous scenarios to maximize code
coverage of the tests.

The previous section introduces data sections provided by `Test::Nginx::Socket`
for examining messages in the NGINX error log file, which is a powerful
tool to check for errors in the tests. Sometimes we want to test more extreme
cases like that the NGINX server even refuses to start up or that the server is
never able to send a well-formed response.
